        "#1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. Objects are instances of classes, which are blueprints for creating objects. OOP allows developers to model real-world entities and their interactions in a program, making it easier to design, manage, and scale complex software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior (attributes and methods) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        " - In simpler terms, a class is like a recipe, and objects are the dishes prepared using that recipe.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " - An object in OOP is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own unique data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). While a class is the blueprint, an object is the actual entity created based on that blueprint.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " - Abstraction\n",
        "  - Definition: Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features or functionality to the user.\n",
        "  - Focus: Focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
        "  - Purpose: To reduce complexity by showing only the relevant details.\n",
        "  - Achieved Through:\n",
        "    - Abstract classes.\n",
        "    - Interfaces.\n",
        "  - Real-World Example:\n",
        "    - When you drive a car, you only interact with the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift. You don’t need to know how the engine works internally.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Encapsulation\n",
        "  - Definition: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "  - Focus: Focuses on how to protect the data and control access to it.\n",
        "  - Purpose: To safeguard the object’s integrity by preventing unauthorized or accidental changes to its data.\n",
        "  - Achieved Through:\n",
        "    - Access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
        "    - Getter and setter methods to control access.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Real-World Example:\n",
        "    - A bank account has private information like account balance. You can deposit or withdraw money, but you can’t directly modify the balance without following the rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "#5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore methods\") are special methods in Python that have double underscores (__) at the beginning and end of their names. They are also known as magic methods or special methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dunder methods are predefined in Python and allow developers to customize the behavior of objects in various situations, such as when performing arithmetic operations, type conversion, or object representation. These methods are not meant to be called directly but are invoked implicitly by Python in certain contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "#6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (called the child class or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called the parent class or superclass). It enables code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "- Key Features of Inheritance\n",
        "  - Code Reusability:\n",
        "The child class can reuse the code from the parent class, reducing redundancy.\n",
        "  - Extensibility:\n",
        "The child class can extend or modify the functionality of the parent class.\n",
        "  - Hierarchy:\n",
        "It creates a relationship between classes, often modeled as an \"is-a\" relationship (e.g., a Dog is an Animal).\n",
        "  - Polymorphism:\n",
        "Through inheritance, a subclass can override or provide its own implementation of methods from the parent class\n",
        "\n",
        "#7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The term \"polymorphism\" means \"many forms\". It enables a single interface to represent different types or behaviors, promoting flexibility and reusability in code.\n",
        "\n",
        "#8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python.\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, ensuring controlled interaction and maintaining data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, encapsulation is achieved through:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Public Access: Attributes and methods that can be accessed directly.\n",
        "  - Protected Access: Attributes and methods intended to be accessed within the class and its subclasses.\n",
        "  - Private Access: Attributes and methods restricted to the class itself.\n",
        "  \n",
        "#9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created. It is automatically called when an object of a class is instantiated. In Python, the constructor method is named __init__().\n",
        "\n",
        "#10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Python provides two special types of methods in addition to instance methods: class methods and static methods. Both are associated with the class rather than any specific instance of the class. They are defined using decorators: classmethod and staticmethod.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Class Methods\n",
        "A class method is a method that operates on the class itself rather than on an instance of the class. It is used when you need to access or modify class-level data (attributes shared among all instances of the class).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Static Methods\n",
        "A static method is a method that does not operate on the instance or the class. It is a utility function that logically belongs to the class but does not require access to class or instance-specific data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#11.  What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within a class. It allows a method to behave differently based on the arguments passed to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In many programming languages like Java or C++, method overloading is achieved by defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or counts. However, Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense because a method name in a class can only refer to one definition at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "#12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. The overridden method in the subclass should have the same name, parameters, and return type as the method in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The purpose of method overriding is to allow a subclass to provide its own specific behavior for a method while retaining the same interface as the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The @property decorator in Python is a built-in feature used to define computed properties in a class. It allows you to define a method that can be accessed like an attribute, providing a way to encapsulate data while maintaining a simple and intuitive interface for the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The property decorator is part of Python's descriptor protocol, and it is commonly used to:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Control access to instance attributes.\n",
        "  - Dynamically compute values when accessing attributes.\n",
        "  - Add validation logic when setting or modifying attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different types of behavior depending on the object that implements it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- This flexibility and dynamic behavior make polymorphism a cornerstone of OOP, contributing to code reusability, extensibility, and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "#15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is designed to be subclassed. It serves as a blueprint for other classes. An abstract class can contain abstract methods, which are methods that are declared but contain no implementation. Subclasses of the abstract class are required to provide implementations for these abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstract classes are part of Python's Abstract Base Classes (ABC) module, which provides a mechanism for defining abstract classes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "#16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "  - Modularity (Encapsulation): OOP allows you to break down a program into smaller, self-contained modules called objects. Each object represents a specific entity or concept and contains both data (attributes) and methods (functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Reusability (Inheritance): OOP supports inheritance, which allows you to create new classes based on existing ones. A subclass inherits attributes and methods from its superclass and can add new features or modify existing ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Flexibility and Extensibility (Polymorphism): Polymorphism allows different objects to respond to the same method in different ways. You can define methods in a base class and override them in subclasses to provide specialized behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "#17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable.\n",
        "- Class variables are used when you want to store data that is common across all instances of a class, while instance variables are used for data that is specific to each instance of the class.\n",
        "- Class variables are accessed using the class name, while instance variables are accessed using the instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python (and other object-oriented programming languages) where a class can inherit from more than one base class. This allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes, enabling more flexibility and reusability in code.\n",
        "\n",
        "#19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "- In Python, the __str__ and __repr__ methods are used to define how objects are represented as strings. They serve different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- __str__:\n",
        "  - The __str__ method is meant to provide a \"user-friendly\" or informal string representation of an object.\n",
        "  - It is called by the str() function and when you print an object using print().\n",
        "  - The goal is to return a string that is easy to read and provides relevant information for end-users.\n",
        "  - If __str__ is not defined, Python will use the __repr__ method (if defined) or the default object representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- __repr__:\n",
        "  - The __repr__ method is meant to provide a \"formal\" or unambiguous string representation of an object, ideally one that can be used to recreate the object using eval().\n",
        "  - It is called by the repr() function and is used in the interactive interpreter to display objects.\n",
        "  - The goal is to return a string that is more technical and useful for debugging, development, or logging.\n",
        "\n",
        "#20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function in Python is used to call a method from a parent (or superclass) in a class, especially when dealing with inheritance. It allows you to access methods and attributes of the parent class, enabling you to extend or override the functionality of the parent class methods in the child class.\n",
        "- Key Significance of super():\n",
        "  - Accessing Parent Class Methods:\n",
        "super() is commonly used to call methods from the parent class in a subclass, which is helpful when you want to extend or modify the behavior of inherited methods without completely overriding them.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Avoiding Direct Parent Class References:\n",
        "Instead of explicitly referring to the parent class (e.g., Animal.speak(self)), super() allows you to refer to the parent class in a more flexible and maintainable way, which is especially useful in multiple inheritance scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Multiple Inheritance:\n",
        "In the case of multiple inheritance, super() ensures that the method resolution order (MRO) is followed correctly. It helps avoid calling the same method multiple times and ensures that the method from the right parent class is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Calling the Parent Constructor (__init__):\n",
        "In many cases, super() is used to call the parent class's __init__ method, allowing the child class to initialize its parent class without needing to explicitly call the parent constructor by name.\n",
        "\n",
        "#21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method in Python is a special method used to define the behavior of an object when it is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. It is often referred to as the destructor of the class, although Python’s garbage collection system does not guarantee when or if __del__ will be called, as it depends on when the object is deleted or the reference count drops to zero.\n",
        "- Significance of __del__:\n",
        "  - Resource Cleanup:\n",
        "The primary purpose of __del__ is to clean up resources when an object is no longer needed. This is especially useful for managing resources like file handles, database connections, or network connections that need to be explicitly closed before the object is destroyed.\n",
        "  - Automatic Cleanup (but not guaranteed):\n",
        "__del__ is meant to automatically clean up resources when an object is destroyed. However, it’s important to note that Python’s garbage collector may not immediately call __del__ when the object’s reference count reaches zero. The timing of when the __del__ method is called is uncertain, so relying on __del__ for critical cleanup operations (e.g., releasing resources) is not always ideal.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Avoiding Resource Leaks:\n",
        "For objects that manage external resources, such as files, sockets, or database connections, defining __del__ ensures that these resources are properly released when the object is no longer needed, preventing resource leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "#22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "-\n",
        "In Python, both @staticmethod and @classmethod are used to define methods that are not bound to an instance of the class, but they differ in how they interact with the class and its instances. Here's a breakdown of the differences:\n",
        "- @staticmethod:\n",
        "  - A static method does not take any special first argument (like self or cls).\n",
        "  - It is bound to the class, not the instance, and can be called on the class or an instance.\n",
        "  - Static methods cannot access or modify the class state or instance state. They are typically used for utility functions that don’t need access to class or instance data.\n",
        "  - You use @staticmethod when the method doesn’t need to know anything about the class or its instances.\n",
        "- @classmethod:\n",
        "  - A class method takes the class itself as the first argument (cls), rather than an instance (self).\n",
        "  - It is bound to the class, not an instance, but it can access or modify the class state (i.e., class variables) and call other class methods.\n",
        "  - Class methods are often used for factory methods (methods that create instances of the class) or methods that need to interact with the class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance.\n",
        "- Polymorphism in Python refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance. It allows methods to have the same name but behave differently depending on the object calling them. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",

        "- Key Points:\n",
        "  - Method Overriding:\n",
        "A subclass can provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows different subclasses to have different behaviors for the same method name.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Dynamic Method Dispatch:\n",
        "In Python, method resolution happens dynamically at runtime, meaning the method that gets called depends on the type of the object at runtime, not the type of the reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "#24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining in Python (or in object-oriented programming in general) refers to the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single statement, where each method returns the object itself or another object that supports further method calls. This allows you to chain multiple method calls together in a concise and readable way.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method chaining is a powerful technique in Python OOP that improves code readability and conciseness by allowing multiple method calls to be linked together. It is particularly useful for configuring objects or when working with immutable objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "#25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- Purpose of __call__:\n",
        "  - Callable Objects: The __call__ method makes an object callable, i.e., it allows an instance of a class to behave like a function. This is useful when you want to represent an object that can be invoked in a similar way to a function or when you want to encapsulate some behavior within an object and still maintain a function-like interface.\n",
        "  - Flexible Behavior: It allows you to define custom behavior when the object is called, which can be useful in cases like function objects, decorators, or when you want to simulate function-like behavior but still maintain the advantages of object-oriented design.\n",
