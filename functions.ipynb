Generators are particularly useful for working with large datasets or infinite streams of data where memory efficiency is important.\n",

When yield is encountered, the function pauses execution and returns the yielded value. The state of the function is saved, so it can resume from where it left off when called again.\n",

        "  - Lazy Evaluation\n",
        "Generators compute and return values on demand. They do not compute values until they are explicitly requested using next() or a loop. This allows efficient processing of large or infinite data streams.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Improved Performance\n",
        "Generators avoid the overhead of creating and storing large data structures (e.g., lists). Since values are generated one at a time, the program runs faster and consumes fewer resources.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Stateless Iteration\n",
        "Generators maintain their internal state between successive calls to next(). This makes them ideal for tasks like streaming data or reading files line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Infinite Sequences\n",
        "Unlike lists, which are finite and stored in memory, generators can represent infinite sequences. This is useful for simulations, streaming data, or mathematical computations.\n",

        "#8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",

        "  - Anonymous: Lambda functions do not have a name unless assigned to a variable.\n",

        "  -Concise: Useful for short, simple operations that can be written in a single line.\n",
