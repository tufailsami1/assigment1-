        "#Python Basics Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "#1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its clean and straightforward syntax, making it beginner-friendly and efficient for developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python is popular because it strikes a balance between simplicity and power, making it suitable for both beginners and professionals. Its vast library support and cross-domain applicability position it as one of the most favored programming languages in the tech industry today.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "- The Python interpreter is the backbone of the language's execution model, enabling you to write and run Python programs effortlessly. Its line-by-line execution and dynamic nature make Python both powerful and user-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "- Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes within the language. These keywords form the backbone of Python’s syntax and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names) in your programs. They are case-sensitive and are always written in lowercase (except True, False, and None).\n",
        "\n",
        "#4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "- No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes within the Python language, and attempting to use them as variable names will result in a Syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "#5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "- Mutability determines whether an object's content can be changed after its creation. While mutable objects are versatile and efficient for dynamic operations, immutable objects ensure stability and consistency in your programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "- Lists are mutable to provide flexibility and dynamic behavior for collections that are expected to change.\n",
        "-Tuples are immutable to ensure consistency, reliability, and efficiency for fixed collections of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "- Equality Operator (==)\n",
        " - Purpose: Compares the values of two objects to check if they are equal.\n",
        " - Checks: The contents of the objects, regardless of whether they are the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Identity Operator(is)\n",
        " - Purpose: Compares the identity of two objects to check if they are the same object in memory.\n",
        " - Checks: Whether two variables point to the same memory location.\n",
        "\n",
        "#8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "- Logical operators in Python are used to perform logical operations on boolean values (True or False). These operators are essential for building conditions and controlling the flow of programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "- Type casting in Python is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. Python provides built-in functions for type casting, allowing you to change the data type of variables to fit the context or requirements of your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "#10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "- Implicit Type Casting: Conversion of data types that is performed automatically by Python without the need for user intervention.\n",
        "- Explicit Type Casting: Conversion of data types that is performed manually by the programmer using Python's built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "#11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "- Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. They allow you to make decisions in your program, executing specific blocks of code only when certain criteria are met. The purpose of conditional statements is to enable programs to react to different inputs or states, providing flexibility and dynamic behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "#12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "- The elif (short for \"else if\") statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions in a sequence. It allows you to test several expressions for True and execute a block of code as soon as one of those conditions evaluates to True. It is part of the chain of conditional statements, and it comes after an if statement and before an else statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The elif statement helps you check additional conditions if the previous ones are False, which makes your code more readable and efficient, especially when you have multiple possible conditions to check.\n",
        "\n",
        "#13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "- for Loop\n",
        " - Purpose: A for loop is used when you know how many times you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
        " - How It Works: The loop iterates over each item in the given sequence or collection and executes the block of code once for each item.\n",
        "\n",
        "- while Loop\n",
        " - Purpose: A while loop is used when you want to keep executing a block of code as long as a condition is True. The number of iterations is not necessarily known in advance.\n",
        " - How It Works: The loop continues to execute the code block until the condition evaluates to False.\n",
        "\n",
        "#14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "- A while loop is more suitable than a for loop in situations where you need to repeat an action until a condition is met, but you don't know the exact number of iterations in advance. It is particularly useful when the loop should continue running as long as a certain condition remains true, rather than iterating over a fixed set of items or a predetermined range."
